By using our Product/Services, you understand that we will collect and use your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you or your organisation has a separate agreement with us, that agreement may have privacy terms that also apply to the information you provide to us under that agreement.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites and apps that you may use, that are linked to in our Products/Services. You should review the terms and policies of any third-party websites and apps before clicking on any links.

As part of our Products/Services, we will collect and record information that helps measure and track our efforts and the validity of any transactions. This information includes the persons who are involved in using the Products/Services and any transactions and the devices those persons use or access.

We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed.

The Internet and technology is constantly changing and that means we'll need to change this page from time to time to keep up with new developments. We encourage you to return here regularly to check for any updates.`,

    title: 'GDPR',
    content: `The focus of the GDPR is increased privacy for the personal "data" of individuals in the EU through the entire life-cycle of collection, use, retention, transfer and deletion of data.
